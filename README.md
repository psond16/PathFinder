# PathFinder 🎨🧭

PathFinder is an interactive vision-to-action canvas that turns personal goals into a living piece of digital art.

Instead of static vision boards, PathFinder helps users break dreams into meaningful steps. Each step appears as part of a black-and-white visual board that gradually transforms into color as progress is made.

Users can replace AI-generated visuals with real photos from their own journey, turning growth into a personal, evolving artwork.
